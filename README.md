# Skill-India-Internship-2021

Here is the project on Inventory Managment System. The project consists of two ipynb files of Purchasing the items from the inventory and adding the items to the inventory which contains the basic code for it. The other files attached are the sales.json file and the record.json file which consists of the total sales that has taken place and the database of the inventory and the number of items present respectively. The project basicly is an Inventory which is used either as a Storage or a Buying Platform.

I have included 4 features in my project:

1. Product-ID
2. Product Name
3. Quantity
4. Price

I have used Json file management system and main codes written in .ipynb format
